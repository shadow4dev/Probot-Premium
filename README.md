# CodersHub Project

## About the Project
All rights reserved to **CodersHub**.  
This project was developed by **Shadow**, a programmer from the CodersHub team.  

### How It Works
This project enables a bot to resend any embedded message, normal message, or other content immediately after it is sent. The bot deletes the original message and sends it back without any modifications, and this process occurs in less than a second.

### Project Video Explanation
A full explanation of the project is available on the developer's YouTube channel (**Shadow**):  
[Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVbNk_m0Zc0&pp=ygUb2KjYsdmI2KjZiNiqINio2LHZitmF2YrZiNmF).

### Free Project
This project is available for free, identical to the one sold on platforms like Maker with currencies such as Credits or Dollars.
